# Cactus Memory Game - React.js

## Goal/Objective

#### Create a simple memory game using React.js by breaking UI into components, setting components' state, and responding to click events.

* The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

* The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
